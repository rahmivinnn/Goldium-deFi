# 3D Animated Backgrounds for Goldium DeFi Platform

## Overview

This document provides information about the 3D animated backgrounds implemented across the Goldium DeFi platform. These backgrounds create a more dynamic and engaging user experience, making the interface more lively and attractive to users.

## Implementation Details

The 3D backgrounds are implemented using:
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber as a React wrapper for Three.js
- React Three Drei for additional helpers and components

The main component is `GlobalBackground.tsx` which is included in the application layout to ensure it appears on all screens.

## Features

The 3D background includes:

1. **Floating Orbs**: Animated golden orbs that float around the scene
2. **Background Sphere**: A large distorted sphere that creates a dynamic backdrop
3. **Golden Rings**: Animated rings that rotate and tilt
4. **Sparkles**: Particle effects that add depth and movement
5. **Clouds**: Subtle cloud effects that enhance the atmosphere

## Customization

The background can be customized by adjusting the `intensity` prop:

```tsx
<GlobalBackground intensity={0.7} />
```

The intensity value ranges from 0 to 1, where:
- 0 = completely transparent (invisible)
- 1 = fully opaque

## Performance Considerations

The 3D backgrounds are designed to be performant, but they can be resource-intensive on lower-end devices. To ensure good performance:

1. The background is rendered with a lower priority than the main UI
2. The component is dynamically imported with SSR disabled
3. The background is fixed and doesn't re-render when the UI changes
4. The number of objects and effects is limited to maintain good performance

## Browser Compatibility

The 3D backgrounds work in all modern browsers that support WebGL:
- Chrome 9+
- Firefox 4+
- Safari 5.1+
- Edge 12+
- Opera 12+

On browsers that don't support WebGL, the background will not be rendered, and the application will fall back to the standard background.

## Disabling 3D Backgrounds

For users who may experience performance issues or prefer a simpler interface, you can add an option to disable the 3D backgrounds:

1. Add a setting in the user preferences
2. Conditionally render the background based on this setting:

```tsx
{userPreferences.enable3DBackgrounds && <GlobalBackground intensity={0.7} />}
```

## File Structure

- `components/three/GlobalBackground.tsx`: Main component for the 3D background
- `components/three/ThreeScene.tsx`: Used in the hero section
- `components/three/FeaturesBackground.tsx`: Used in the features section
- `components/three/CTABackground.tsx`: Used in the call-to-action section

## Testing DeFi Functionality

To ensure all DeFi features are fully functional and properly tested across all supported networks, we've implemented a comprehensive testing script.

### Running the Tests

To run the DeFi functionality tests:

```bash
npm run test:defi
```

or

```bash
yarn test:defi
```

### What's Tested

The test script verifies the following functionality across Mainnet, Testnet, and Devnet:

1. **Swapping Functionality**
   - Transaction creation
   - Transaction approval
   - Transaction simulation
   - Fee estimation

2. **Staking Functionality**
   - Stake transaction creation
   - Stake transaction approval
   - Stake transaction simulation

3. **Liquidity Provision**
   - Add liquidity transaction creation
   - Add liquidity transaction approval
   - Add liquidity transaction simulation

4. **Security Features**
   - Transaction approval for high-value transactions
   - Risk level assessment
   - Hardware wallet recommendations
   - Anomaly detection

### Test Results

The test script outputs a summary of the test results for each network, indicating whether each feature passed or failed.

Example output:

```
=== Test Results Summary ===

mainnet-beta:
- Swap: ✅ PASS
- Staking: ✅ PASS
- Liquidity: ✅ PASS
- Security: ✅ PASS

testnet:
- Swap: ✅ PASS
- Staking: ✅ PASS
- Liquidity: ✅ PASS
- Security: ✅ PASS

devnet:
- Swap: ✅ PASS
- Staking: ✅ PASS
- Liquidity: ✅ PASS
- Security: ✅ PASS
```

## Value Updates

As requested, all instances of "2.5M" have been updated to "1M" throughout the application. This includes:

1. Total Value Locked (TVL) in the StatsSection component
2. TVL values in the liquidity pools data
3. TVL values in the pools page

The total TVL across all pools now sums to $2M instead of the previous $5.72M.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the 3D backgrounds:

1. **Performance Issues**: Reduce the intensity or disable the backgrounds
2. **Rendering Issues**: Ensure your browser supports WebGL and has hardware acceleration enabled
3. **Mobile Devices**: Consider using a simplified version of the background on mobile devices

If you encounter issues with the DeFi functionality tests:

1. **Network Connectivity**: Ensure you have a stable connection to the Solana networks
2. **API Rate Limits**: If you hit rate limits, add delays between tests or use different endpoints
3. **Test Failures**: Check the error messages for specific issues and fix them accordingly
